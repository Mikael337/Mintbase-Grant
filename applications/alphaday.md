### Overview

Alphaday is a powerful workflow aggregator that pulls in crypto news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, social feeds, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 

Our research showed that crypto users are overwhelmed with information and spend hours jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in their favourite community. 

Having all this information in one place allows Idle stakeholders (i.e. users, developers, investors) to easily stay up to date on Idle ecosystem updates, see the latest news and developments, do research and stay engaged. In general, users who can track their favourite projects more easily stay more engaged with the project which in turn supports user retention. 

Our application is blockchain-agnostic and can be utilized by any cryptocurrency-based project.

No other project has tried to aggregate users’ entire workflows into a single easy-to-use experience. Dune/Nansen focus on on-chain data, Messari focuses on investment research, Zapper and Zerion focus on portfolio tracking etc etc. Alphaday from the ground up aggregates every single crypto touch-point whether its consuming audio and visual content, using dapps, collecting NFTs, or reading discussion forums into one ‘homepage’.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

Our app is live at : http://app.alphaday.com/
Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

Social- A data aggregator as a Community dashboard.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We aim to create a dashboard that serves any Mintbase user, holders, developers, VCs, and pretty much any stakeholder whether they are completely new to the Mintbase ecosystem or an expert.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Having an Alphaday dashboard for Mintbase will make it easier to consume 50+ different types of Mintbase-related information in one place. Users can customize this experience to meet their own individual needs. Once they have a solution that is exactly tailored to their needs, they are more likely to stay engaged and informed. 

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

We do not have direct competitors who are competing in the experience aggregator space but our individual widgets do overlap with features offered by Dune, Nansen, Zapper/Zerion, Coingecko, Discord, DeFiLama, Snapshot.
Bear in mind that the above are feeding data to Alphaday itself.

We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People use Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into Alphaday so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months (plus 12 months of maintenance)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 4,000 USD

### Milestone 1 — Dashboard Development and Deployment

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 2,000 USD

We would like to create a Mintbase ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Blog | The latest Mintbase official announcements and blog post content |
| 0b. | News | A feed of all news mentions of Mintbase from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet |
| 0c. | Calendar | A calendar containing all Mintbase events including Mintbase Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Mintbase bounties, AMAs |
| 0d. | Podcast | Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Mintbase team members |
| 0e. | Videos | Youtube stream containing educational Mintbase content.
| 0f. | Documentation | Mintbase Document directory |  
| 0g. | Forum | Integration with Mintbase Governance Forum to show the latest and trending discussion topics |  
| 0h. | Social | Discord & Reddit Integration to show a feed of latest discussions |  
| 0i. | Misc | FAQs for Devs & Creators |
| 0j. | Developer Resources | Developer tools, API’s, tutorials, guides, grants & bounties, documentation, and any other ‘Build’ resources that can help build with Mintbase. |  
| 0k. | Careers | Mintbase Careers integration to show the latest open jobs listed on Mintbase  |  
| 0l. | Roadmap |  A widget featuring the Mintbase roadmap with all the descriptions and links included. |  
| 0m. | Ecosystem | Links and descriptions of NFTs by category as well as featured contracts and other platforms within the Mintbase ecosystem |  

We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Gnosis dashboard by early November 2023 (tentatively).

Thereafter, we will actively maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis for at least a year, as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as requested by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/ 

### Milestone 2 — Daily Maintenance of Dashboard

- **Estimated Duration:** 12 months
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 2,000 USD

Daily maintenance and any other changes, additions, removals, required by the dashboard throughout a year (indefinitely).
...
## Future Plans
Our workflow for building the Mintbase Community Dashboard is as follows:
1. Our team creates a list of all the sources of information relevant to the Mintbase ecosystem (we usually collect 30+ sources including official blog posts, social media, discussion forums, podcasts, etc)
2. We build a draft dashboard that is composed of the widgets we think best serve the Mintbase community based on our experience building for other projects.
3. We share the dashboard with the Mintbase community and/or team and we collect feedback.
4. We change & iterate based on the feedback and once we get final approval from the community and/or team we publish it.
5. We also do social marketing campaigns to promote the dashboard
6. Optional: We create a Zealy campaign to try to boost early user adoption of the Mintbase dashboard.
7. We continue to maintain, curate, and develop the dashboard continuously.
8. If we get any early traction on the Mintbase dashboard we can immediately start to build more Mintbase-exclusive widgets.
